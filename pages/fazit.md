# Fazit

reinforcement learning looks promising

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

- DRL for anomaly detection is in its infancy
- developing extensible approaches is important
- achieved comparable, reproducible results
- more datasets improve evaluation of the method
- can there be more feature observations?
- can we think about real-world use cases?
