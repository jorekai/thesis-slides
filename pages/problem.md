# Problem

abstraction and understanding

<br>
<br>
<br>

- the problem depends on three large areas
- approach can be seen as $AD \cap RL$
- learn the mathematical properties of $AD \cap TS$
- incorporate the information of $RL \cap TS$
- deduct the problem model as $AD \cap RL \cap TS$
- next: look at the different point of views
